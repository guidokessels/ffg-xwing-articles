_![](f03ee59f957f72a4f32174a8ff094028.png)_

Feared by friend and foe alike, Darth Vader is the living embodiment of the Empire’s might.

Now he is ready to carry out the Emperor’s bidding by decimating the Rebel Alliance wherever it can be found.

As outposts and data centers, Imperial bunkers play a pivotal role in securing the Empire's reign over the galaxy. Found on Imperial-controlled planets such as Scarif and the forest moon of Endor, these bunkers keep safe some of the Empire's most vital military secrets and command centers.

_![](f9f0b1e0908963a464b2e486bb461c8f.png)_

The Galactic Republic’s Phase I Clone Troopers are always armed with state-of-the-art equipment.

_![](af64b9be4921bb726d85afd822da8cfa.png)_

The Separatist Alliance’s B1 Battle Droids are manufactured to attack in massive numbers and wear down enemy forces through raw attrition alone. But that does not mean they don't have other purposes to serve as the Separatists seek to overthrow the Galactic Republic.

A ubiquitous sight across the galaxy, white-armored stormtroopers strike fear into the hearts of all those who would oppose the Empire.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The _Starhawk_\-class Battleship was the first capital ship commissioned by the nascent New Republic Defense Fleet after the Battle of Endor. Assembled at the Nadiri Dockyards from the salvage of captured Star Destroyers, _Concord_ served as the flagship for Commodore Kyrsta Agate during the capture of the infamous Kuat Drive Yards, while _Amity_ and _Unity_ joined her in time for the climactic Battle of Jakku. There, all three Starhawks bore the brunt of the battle to destroy the remnants of the Galactic Empire.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The _Onager_\-class Star Destroyer is a specialized platform for some of the Empire’s most dangerous weaponry. The arrival of its ominous silhouette in orbit heralds a bombardment by massive particle cannons, or, more rarely, a devastating pulse from superheavy composite beam turbolasers. Its deployment in more sensitive Imperial operations can be neither confirmed nor denied.

The _Onager-class Star Destroyer Expansion Pack_ for _Star Wars_™: Armada provides your imperial officers with everything you need to add 1 Onager-class Star Destroyer to your game, including 1 painted ship, 1 speed dial, 3 command dials, 2 ship cards, 15 upgrade cards, and a collection of assorted tokens.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As the personal ship of the First Order elite ace Major Baron Elrik Vonreg, the Sienar-Jaemus Fleet Systems TIE/ba Baron Space Superiority Interceptor strikes fear in the hearts of even the most grizzled Resistance pilots. Major Vonreg personally guided the enhancement of proven designs, transforming the Empire's TIE/in Interceptor into the First Order's TIE/ba Interceptor, a one-of-a-kind precise and lethal craft.

Engineered with precision and lethality in mind, the TIE/ba interceptor has many ways to put pressure on your opponents. Whether you're using its prodigious speed, fine-tuned thrusters or missiles, a single skilled pilot can wreak havoc on squadrons unprepared to face them.

Within this expansion, you’ll find six pilots ready to fight for the First Order, as well as six upgrade cards to fine-tune your TIE/ba interceptor’s capabilities. Accompanying these are two Quick Build cards with pre-built combinations of pilots and upgrades to help you get flying right away.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A labor of love to the crew of Jarek Yeager’s garage, the _Fireball_ is a highly combustible, scratch-built racing ship. Flown by undercover Resistance operative Kazuda Xiono, this explosion with wings is able to push the limit around the course before living up to its name. Lightly armed but lightning fast, the _Fireball_ can careen around the battlefield, gaining a  superior position on almost any enemy.

Already an explosively fast racing machine, the _Fireball_ is also highly customizable, giving you the chance to make your own modifications that fit your personal style.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The reptilian bounty hunter Bossk is as tenacious as he is notorious, pursuing his targets doggedly in his customized YV-666 light freighter, the _Hound’s Tooth_, or launching his Z-95-AF4 Headhunter to engage other starfighters up-close and personal. Beside Bossk, the YV-666’s spacious triple-decker design makes it popular with bounty hunters of all stripes, who often retrofit an entire deck for prisoner transport.

Now, the infamous _Hound's Tooth_ can be a part of your Scum and Villainy squadrons, giving you a contingency plan if a battle turns in your opponent’s favor. Any pilot can escape via the _Nashtah Pup_, but Bossk himself can partner with whoever pilots the Hound’s Tooth to track down a target together.

The _Hound’s Tooth Expansion Pack_ contains everything you need to start your own bounty hunting career, including a YV-666 light freighter miniature and a Z-95-AF4 Headhunter miniature painted in the striking _Nashtah Pup_ scheme. Joining these miniatures are six ship cards—four for the YV-666 and two for the Z-95-AF4 Headhunter—and fourteen upgrade cards. Finally, three Quick Build Cards give you even more options for deploying your YV-666.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With incredible engine output, a lightweight frame, and precise thrusters for close maneuvering, the TIE/in interceptor is a vessel for the most elite Imperial aces. Only those with nerves of steel can ride the knife’s edge to draw out this craft’s full potential. This includes the ship’s four wing-mounted laser cannons, a dramatic increase in firepower over its predecessors.

Not only is the TIE/in interceptor the craft of choice of the Empire’s elite Saber Squadron, this fighter group is led by the legendary Soontir Fel, one of the best starfighter pilots in the galaxy. Taking full advantage of the ship’s maneuverability, Fel is the bane of Rebel squadrons across the galaxy.

The _TIE/in Interceptor Expansion Pack_ gives you the chance to put Soontir Fel and three other pilots at the controls of this swift and deadly craft. Joining them are five upgrade cards that give these elite pilots even more advantages in the thick of a space battle. Finally, two Quick Build cards provide useful combinations of pilots and upgrades, allowing you to test all of the TIE/in interceptor’s capabilities.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A fighter so powerful and advanced that Phoenix Squadron feared its mass production could make the Imperial Navy unbeatable, the TIE/D defender features powerful shields, speed and maneuverability, and a suite of potent weapons including missiles and cannons. In the right ace’s hands, the TIE/D defender can bring down nearly any target.

As a departure from the design of most Imperial starfighters, the Defender opens a wide range of possibilities for Imperial squadrons. Rather than rely on large numbers of small fighters, this ship gives the Empire an option that can match more powerful Rebel fighters. The TIE/D defender is also highly customizable, and adding a variety of systems and weapons can give it the edge in battle.

Within the TIE/D Defender Expansion Pack, you’ll find everything you need to bulk up your Imperial squadrons, including a TIE/D defender miniature, five ship cards, and four upgrade cards that invite you to outfit your ship with new systems, missiles, and cannons.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The favored craft of Rebel aces who value precision handling, the RZ-1 A-wing can fit through narrow gaps between obstacles or fly circles around enemy craft. What these nimble interceptors lack in durability, they more than make up for in speed and maneuverability.

The RZ-1 proved its worth by crippling Star Destroyers during the Battle of Endor, and it now adds its deadly speed to Rebel squadrons across the galaxy. Skilled pilots make the most of the RZ-1’s capabilities, turning the ship’s maneuverability into an offensive asset.

The RZ-1 A-Wing Expansion Pack includes everything you need to add one of these speedy ships to your Rebel Alliance squadrons. An RZ-1 A-wing miniature painted in the colors of Phoenix Squadron is accompanied by four ship cards representing the Rebel pilots willing to take on the challenge of flying this craft. You can improve these pilots’ capabilities in battle with five upgrade cards of your choosing, or you can take the recommendations of two Quick Build cards for even more ways to use your RZ-1 A-wing.
