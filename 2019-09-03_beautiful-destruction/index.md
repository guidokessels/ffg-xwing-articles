Stay on Target
--------------

Whether your ships are hit by blasters or proton torpedoes, the damage they take in a game of _X-Wing_ is normally tracked by the standard damage deck included in the _X-Wing Core Set_. With these damage decks, however, you can personalize the look of your squadron by replacing this deck with one that matches the colors of your chosen faction.

Each deck contains a complete set of thirty-three illustrated damage cards that correspond to those in the standard damage deck. While the text of these cards might match, their graphic design makes it clear that your squadron belongs to a particular faction. But these decks do more than simply indicate where your loyalties lie. The cards themselves cleary pinpoint the damaged portion of your ship in Aurebesh on a diagnostic display of one of your faction's starfighters.

Those flying as part of the Rebel Alliance, for example, will see their damage on a readout of a BTL-A4 Y-wing starfighter.

Heading into battle with the next generation of Imperial designs, damage to First Order ships is displayed on a TIE/sf Fighter.

Those loyal to the Galactic Republic can assess their damage with an image of a Delta-7 _Aethersprite_.

Finally, squadrons committed to the Separatist Alliance see their damage displayed on the faction’s most iconic starfighter: the _Vulture-_class Droid Fighter.

In addition to graphic design unique to each damage deck, the cards have been expanded to a larger size. Rather than using the Mini American Board Game card size, as in the _X-Wing Core Set_, these damage decks feature LCG® size cards, making them even easier to read and use in battle.
