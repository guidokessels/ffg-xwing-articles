_Development of_ Star Wars_: X-Wing,_ Star Wars_: Armada, and_ Star Wars_: Legion Moving from Fantasy Flight Games to Asmodee’s Miniatures Games-Focused Studio_

**SEATTLE, WA, November 16, 2020** – In a strategic reorganization of its _Star Wars_ miniatures titles, Asmodee is announcing today that oversight of its three _Star Wars_ miniatures titles will be moving to their dedicated miniatures games studio, Atomic Mass Games.

Development of all future miniatures games will be handled by Atomic Mass as well. The move to a specialty studio positions Asmodee’s miniatures titles for even greater success in the future.

“Atomic Mass is committed to bringing people together through fun games, and _Star Wars_ has been bringing people together through the power of myth and story for over 40 years,” Steve Horvath, Head of US Publishing, said. “Combining their talent with the strength of our current _Star Wars_ miniatures games and the limitless possibilities of a galaxy far, far away is going to lead to incredible new experiences for tabletop gamers and Star Wars fans to enjoy.”

Simone Elliott, who has shepherded Fantasy Flight’s relationship with Lucasfilm Licensing since 2015, will lead Atomic Mass Games during this time of expansion as Head of Studio. Will Shick assumes primary creative oversight as Head of Product Development. Joining them will be key members of the teams involved in the creation and evolution of Fantasy Flight’s current _Star Wars_ miniatures games, [_Star Wars_™: X-Wing](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/x-wing-second-edition/), [_Star Wars_™: Legion](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/star-wars-legion/), and [_Star Wars_™: Armada](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/star-wars-armada/).
