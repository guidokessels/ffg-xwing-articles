[Servants of Strife Squadron Pack](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/x-wing-second-edition/products/servants-strife-squadron-pack/) ![](01633a54743be826dd205094b52a3c61.png)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

War! The Separatist Alliance has driven a spike into the heart of the galaxy, splintering the once-unified worlds with choas, tyranny, and fear. At the heart of this offensive is the dastardly General Grievous, commanding endless legions of droid fighters. 

Swarms of networked _Vulture_\-class fighters commanded by tactical droids strike at innocent worlds, forcing the Republic on the defensive. All the while, Grievous slinks through the shadows in his customized Belbullab-22 starfighter; hunting the Jedi at every turn. 

This _Squadron Pack_ contains everything you need to add one Belbullab-22 starfighter and two _Vulture_\-class droid fighter ships to your games of _[X-Wing](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/x-wing-second-edition/)_, including new ship and upgrade cards, three maneuver dials, and an array of tokens.

[Sith Infiltrator Expansion Pack](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/x-wing-second-edition/products/sith-infiltrator-expansion-pack/) ![](d9dfcc108802a0bbdcade6982522fc70.png)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Sith operate in the shadows. As they unfold their dark machinations across the galaxy, they need a ship that matches their nefarious purposes. Casting a menacing shadow as it cuts across the skies, the Sith Infiltrator is the perfect choice to carry the agents of Darth Sidious on their dark missions and into the battles of _X-Wing_.

With the _Sith Infiltrator Expansion Pack_, you can use the experimental cloaking device, devastating firepower, and advanced systems of one of these ships to deliver vicious surgical strikes before vanishing into the void. In addition to the finely detailed and fully painted Sith Infiltrator miniature, you’ll find a collection of five ship cards, including Darth Maul himself, twenty upgrade cards that help you fully utilize the ship’s systems, and all the tokens and maneuver dials you need to launch your own secret missions.

[_Vulture_\-class Droid Fighter Expansion Pack](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/x-wing-second-edition/products/vulture-class-droid-fighter-expansion/) ![](c279e0cc1abba6d2412bb85bd110fbd8.png)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The _Vulture_\-class droid fighter is the backbone of the Separatist Navy and emblematic of its strategy: weak in isolation, but overwhelming in numbers. A sufficiently vast swarm of networked attackers form a cunning, sinister intelligence that can defeat even wise and powerful Jedi pilots.

The Vulture-_class Droid Fighter Expansion Pack_ contains everything you need to begin building your own squadron of linked droid starfighters—most importantly, a beautifully pre-painted _Vulture_\-class droid fighter miniature. Additionally, five ship cards give you the ability to outfit your droid fighter with distinct types of programming while five upgrade cards provide even more freedom to shape your squadron.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Galactic Republic is crumbling, reeling from the blow dealt by the fledgling Separatist Alliance. But even in this age of uncertainty and disunion, heroes arise. Legendary Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi valiantly leads dedicated clone pilots into battle against the forces of tyranny and chaos in the _Guardians of the Republic Squadron Pack_ for _X-Wing_!

This pack gives you everything you need to begin building your Galactic Republic squadrons, including one Delta-7 _Aethersprite_ miniature and two V-19 Torrent miniatures. The chosen interceptor of many Jedi, the Delta-7 allows them to use their Force-enhanced reflexes to the fullest. Behind them, clone pilots cover them from their V-19 Torrents with coordinated fire, tight formation flying, and salvoes of missilies. In addition to the miniatures, this Squadron Pack gives you the chance to further explore the potential of the Force with several new Force upgrade cards. Meanwhile, a variety of other upgrade cards—including reprints of many common neutral upgrade cards—provide a wealth of options for customizing your squadrons.

[ARC-170 Starfighter Expansion Pack](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/x-wing-second-edition/products/arc-170-starfighter-expansion-pack/) _![](a8e2722da8e2b56ad43457510b853bd1.png)_ 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ARC-170 is the Galactic Republic's mainstay heavy starfighter. Equipped torpedoes allow this intimidating craft to smash through foes that might repel the Republic's more lightly armed ships, while its rear gunner makes it difficult to approach from most angles. Whether defending the flanks of a formation or giving support to a Jedi General, the ARC-170 has an imposing presence on the battlefield.

With the _ARC-170 Starfighter Expansion Pack_, you can bring a single ARC-170 starfighter to your _X-Wing_ battles.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Delta-7 _Aethersprite_ is an elegant craft designed to help Jedi Knights cross the gulfs between the stars in their quest to uphold justice. Equipped with an astromech for navigation, it is lightly armed but highly maneuverable, its fine-tuned controls allowing a Force-sensitive pilot to fly it with unmatched precision. 

With five ship cards—including four unique pilots—the _Delta-7_ Aethersprite _Expansion Pack_ adds even more Jedi for you to include in your Galactic Republic squadrons, including the legendary Anakin Skywalker.
